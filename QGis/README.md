# Software
The software to use for this project is [QGis](https://www.qgis.org/fr/site/) and with Ubuntu it can be readily installed thanks to **Ubuntu Software**.

# Issues
After a meeting with Laulau, I have more clues about the files and directories of interest.

File of interest:
 - .adf
 - .adj
 - .aux
 - .lyr

Directories of interest:
 - ReefsAtRiskInTheCaribbean/Lambert
 - ReefsAtRiskRevisited/Global_Threats/Acidification
 - ReefsAtRiskRevisited/Global_Threats/Future_Thermal_Stress


# Proposed solutions

## Fix for .lyr files
The proposed fixes essentially come from the [SLYR Community Edition](https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/tag/lyr/) plugin for which I got a [full tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpdw-gXm7KI).  
The plugin serves the purpose to convert the proprietary **.lyr** format into a QGis-compatible format that is **.qml**.


## Fix for .aux files
According to the [QGIS StackExchange forum](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/62857/how-to-open-aux-file-in-qgis), **.aux** files are auxiliary files in ArcGIS that contain additional information related to a Raster file. So, to fix this one I'd first find a raster file to work on. But that doesn't look easy, I don't recognize any of these file extensions...  
Okay I got it!! According to the [gis documentation on the adf file format](https://docs.fileformat.com/gis/adf/), adf files are raster data file format. So, this one should be fixed by fixing the loading of the adf files. Sounds easy to me. :sob:
