Reefs at Risk Revisited Project
Downloadable Datasets - February, 2011
=======================================

The Reefs at Risk Revisited (RRR) datasets reflect the range of data
assembled and model results developed under the RRR project.

This document provides an overview of the contents of the downloadable zip files,
documentation, and details regarding software requirements.

DATA DOCUMENTATION
==================

Data documentation has been provided in several locations.

1) A metadata file (METADATA.XLS) provides a brief summary of 
the data sets in the zip file, their source information, some notes
about their use, base scale/resolution information, and their location
within the directory structure in the zip file.

2) Individual, detailed metadata files have been provided for every dataset. 
These contain a short text description of the data files, andwhere needed, 
a list of the variables and definitions.


Metadata
--------

METADATA.XLS (located within each zip file) provides a summary of the data within the zip file. 
These data represent those assembled under the project as base data and input to the model, 
as well as results of modeling of threats to coral reefs.  

Threats from coastal development, marine-based pollution and damage, overfishing and destructive 
fishing, and watershed-based pollution were analyzed separately.  These threats were integrated 
into the Integrated Local Threat index.  Global (i.e., climate-related) threats were also 
analyzed.  These include: past thermal stress (i.e., warming seas and bleaching over the last decade), 
future thermal stress (ie., projections of future warming in 2030 and 2050); and ocean acidification 
(i.e., reduced ocean pH in the present, 2030, and 2050). Past thermal stress was integrated with local 
threats into the Integrated Local Threat and Past Thermal Stress index.  Future thermal stress and ocean 
acidification were integrated with local threats into the Integrated Local and Global Threat indices for 
2030 and 2050.

==================================
VIEWING THE DATA AND MODEL RESULTS
==================================

The GIS data are in ArcMap shapefile format (for vector data), or ArcInfo
GRID format (for raster data).  All data are in a WGS 1984 Datum and a 
Cylindrical Equal-Area (Lambert) projection, with a Central Meridian at -160.

Projects are included in each folder with datasets already loaded.

Format for projects is ESRI ArcGIS ArcMap version 9.3.1. (.MXD)

If you have ArcGIS 9.x or 10 installed on your machine, open ArcMap and navigate to the desired file. 
These files provide pointers to both the vector and GRID data on the CD.

NB: These files are not compatible with version 8.x of ESRI's ArcGIS software.
